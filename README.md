## Title of the Project
### MISSING PERSONS LOCATOR AND ALERT SYSTEM USING FACE RECOGNITION

## ABSTRACT
The issue of missing persons is a significant problem in India, with thousands of individuals, particularly women, children, and elderly people, going missing 
each year. The reasons behind these disappearances range from human trafficking, kidnapping, and abductions to natural calamities, accidents, and 
mental health issues. In India, limited resources, lack of awareness, and inadequate coordination between different agencies contribute to the difficulty 
in locating missing individuals and providing timely alerts to concerned families and authorities. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), a significant number of people remain untraced every year, adding to the emotional and social burden on families. The lack of an integrated system for tracking missing persons further complicates the process of locating them.A comprehensive solution to address this problem could include the use of technology, such as mobile-based applications, GPS tracking, and AI-powered systems, to search for and locate missing persons efficiently. A real-time notification and alert system would help inform families and authorities once a missing person is located. Such systems, integrated with local law enforcement databases and public awareness programs, can significantly reduce the number of missing cases and improve the speed at which people are found, ultimately ensuring the safety and well-being of individuals in society.


## About
The project aims to address the critical issue of missing persons using advanced technologies such as Machine Learning (ML) and CCTV surveillance systems. 
With an increasing number of individuals, especially children and elderly people, going missing each year, the challenge of locating them in a timely 
manner has become a major concern for authorities and families alike. Current methods of tracking missing persons rely heavily on manual efforts, such as 
relying on tip-offs or reports from citizens, which can be slow and inefficient.This project seeks to enhance the search process by utilizing CCTV camera 
networks and integrating them with machine learning models to automatically identify, track, and locate missing persons. By training machine learning 
algorithms on large datasets of human behavior and movement patterns, the system will be capable of detecting individuals in real-time through CCTV 
footage. The ML model can recognize specific features like appearance, clothing, and behavior patterns, making it easier to trace missing individuals 
even in crowded or complex environments.The solution will employ image processing techniques to analyze the CCTV footage, identify the person of interest, and send real-time alerts to authorities or family members when a match is found. By combining surveillance infrastructure with cutting-edge AI, this project aims to significantly reduce the time required to locate missing persons, enhance public safety, and provide peace of mind to families.

## Results and Impact

The "Missing Person Detection and Alert System" project aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of locating missing individuals using advanced technologies like facial recognition, AI, and deep learning models. By analyzing images or video footage from public spaces or surveillance cameras, the system can identify potential matches with missing persons reported in national databases. Once a match is detected, automated alerts are immediately sent to law enforcement agencies, family members, and relevant authorities, providing real-time information such as location and time stamps to facilitate quick action. This integration with national databases ensures the system remains updated, enhancing its ability to recognize both new and long-standing cases, ultimately speeding up the recovery process and improving public safety.
